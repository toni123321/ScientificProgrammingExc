    This method will flip the x and y coordinates in the coords array.

    :param coords: A numpy array of bounding box coordinates with shape [n,5] in format:
        ::

            [[x11, y11, x12, y12, classid1],
             [x21, y21, x22, y22, classid2],
             ...
             [xn1, yn1, xn2, yn2, classid3]]

    :return: The new numpy array where the x and y coordinates are flipped.

    **This method is part of a series of debugging exercises.**
    **Each Python method of this series contains bug that needs to be found.**

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> coords = np.array([[10, 5, 15, 6, 0],
    ...                    [11, 3, 13, 6, 0],
    ...                    [5, 3, 13, 6, 1],
    ...                    [4, 4, 13, 6, 1],
    ...                    [6, 5, 13, 16, 1]])
    >>> swapped_coords = swap(coords)

    The example demonstrates the issue. The returned swapped_coords are expected to have swapped
    x and y coordinates in each of the rows.
