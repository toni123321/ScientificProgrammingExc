    This method returns the fruit name by getting the string at a specific index of the set.

    | ``1   It does not print the fruit at the correct index, why is the returned result wrong?``
    Sets in Python aren't ordered and they appear in random order. 
    This means fruits input parameter will be randomly ordered which causes wrong output.
    | ``2   How could this be fixed?``
    This can be fixed by simply using a list.

    This example demonstrates the issue:
    name1, name3 and name4 are expected to correspond to the strings at the indices 1, 3, and 4:
    'orange', 'kiwi' and 'strawberry'..

    This can be fixed by simply using a list. 
    If we want to remove duplicates we can use a dictionary.
